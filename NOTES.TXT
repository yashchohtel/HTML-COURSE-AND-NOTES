HISTORY OF HTML => Early Beginnings (1980's) The concept of hypertext was proposed by computer scientist Ted Nelson in the 1960s. In the 1980s,Berners-lee, a British computer scientist introduced the world wide web (www) and developed the first HTML.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 1 :- What is HTML ?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language 
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 2 :- What is HyperText ?
HyperText is Text which contains links to other texts.The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965.
HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. It refert to a word or phrase that can be linked to another document ot text. hypertext involves only text. 

-------------------------------------------------

Que 3 :-What is hypermedia ?
HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text. It can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.
Hypermedia is an extension to what is known as hypertext, or the ability to open new Web pages by clicking text links on a Web browser. Hypermedia extends upon this by allowing the user to click images, movies, graphics and other media apart from text to create a nonlinear network of information.

------------------------------------------------- 

Que 4 :- What is hyperlinks ?
In a website hyperlinks or link is like a word or a button that point to another location. To navigate online content, Hyperlink can point to the web content with its part of the website or external website. Hyperlink contain url of the webpage.
A link on which hypertext is connected, means when we click on the hypertext and it goes on speficif url that is called "Hyperlink".

-------------------------------------------------

Que 5 :-  What is Markup language ?
Markup language it's a way to give instructions to a computer about how content should be organized and displayed.
A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page and the data it contains. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML (standard generalized markup language), and XML (extensible markup language).

-------------------------------------------------

Que 6 :- what is html syntax?
<h1> THIS IS H1 TAG </h1>
here <h1> is opening tag || THIS IS H1 TAG is content || </h1> is closeing tag -> the conbination of opening tag closeing tag and content is syntax in html.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 7 :- what is difference between tag and syntax?
HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not. There is a subtle difference between HTML elements and tags that many people aren't aware of.

HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should display content to the user. A tag starts with a < bracket and ends with a > bracket. Most tags exist in pairs in HTML. Tags have an opening and closing part. They are similar, except the closing part has a / sign after the opening bracket.

Opening tag: <TagName>
Closing tag: </TagName>

HTML Element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag. HTML Elements are components of the web page. Let's say we created a div block and filled it with some text. Then the text-filled div becomes the component of the HTML Page. The <div></div> tags along with the content inside it becomes a component and HTML Element. This will be rendered and shown to the user.

<p>This is an element<p>

An HTML element consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 8 :- What is the index in html?
index.html is an HTML file that serves as the home page for a website. It's often the first file that visitors to a website will see.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 9 :- Document structure in HTML or boilerplate code. ( https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure )

HTML documents include a document type declaration { <!DOCTYPE html> } and the { <html> </html> } root element. Nested in the <html> element are the document head {  <head> </head> } and document body { <body> </body> } . While the head of the document isn't visible to the sighted visitor, it is vital to make your site function. It contains all the meta information, including information for search engines and social media results, icons for the browser tab and mobile home screen shortcut, and the behavior and presentation of your content.


<!DOCTYPE html> 
The first thing in any HTML document is the preamble. For HTML, all you need is <!DOCTYPE html>. This may look like an HTML element, but it isn't. All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: <!DOCTYPE html>.



<html></html>
The <html> element is the root element for an HTML document. It is the parent of the <head> and <body>, containing everything in the HTML document other than the doctype. It is important to include it, as this is the element on which the language of the content of the document is declared.
<html lang="en"> </html> - The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content. Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French, and so on.

The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. The value of the lang attribute is a two- or three-letter ISO language code followed by the region. The region is optional, but recommended, as a language can vary greatly between regions. For example, French is very different in Canada (fr-CA) versus Burkina Faso (fr-BF). This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and translation services to know the document language.

The lang attribute is not limited to the <html>tag. If there is text within the page that is in a language different from the main document language, the lang attribute should be used to identify exceptions to the main language within the document. Just like when it is included in the head, the lang attribute in the body has no visual effect. It only adds semantics, enabling assistive technologies and automated services to know the language of the impacted content.



<head></head>
The <head>, or document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application. The body contains the visible content. The rest of this section focuses on the components found nested inside the opening and closing <head></head>

Que 18 :- What is img or image tag in html?
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
src - Specifies the path to the image. alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
<img src="link or image" alt="alternae text" >

Image tag attributes 

a. src: -> Specifies the path to the image 
b. atl: -> Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed 
c. height and width: -> The height and width can be set in terms of pixels. The <img> height attribute is used to set the height of the image in pixels. The <img> width attribute is used to set the width of the image in pixels 
d. loading: -> The loading attribute specifies whether a browser should load an image immediately or to defer loading of off-screen images until for example the user scrolls near them.

Image tag map attribute
The <map> tag is used to define an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The required name attribute of the <map> element is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

The <area> tag defines an area inside an image map (an image map is an image with clickable areas). <area> elements are always nested inside a <map> tag.

The coords attribute specifies the coordinates of an area in an image map. The coords attribute is used together with the shape attribute to specify the size, shape, and placement of an area.

Value               	Description
x1,y1,x2,y2          :	Specifies the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corner of the rectangle (shape="rect")

x,y,radius	         :  Specifies the coordinates of the circle center and the radius (shape="circle")

x1,y1,x2,y2,..,xn,yn :	Specifies the coordinates of the edges of the polygon. If the first and last coordinate pairs are not the same, the browser will add the last coordinate pair to close the polygon (shape="poly")

-------------------------------------------------

Que 19 :- What is picture tag and figure tag?
The <picture> tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. The most common use of the <picture> element will be for art direction in responsive designs. As the picture tag allows the inclusion of multiple sources inside it. It supports modern image formats like avif, and webp, which are highly responsive. Additional advantages for picture tags include the support for partially supported image formats and Chrome DevTools support.

<source>: The Media or Image Source element. The <source> HTML element specifies one or more media resources for the <picture> , <audio> , and <video> elements. It is a void element, which means that it has no content and does not require a closing tag

Que 20 :- What is list in html?
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists. The Basics of HTML Lists. HTML lists come in three main categories: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. Each type serves a specific purpose and can be customized to fit your design and content needs.

UNORDERED LIST
Unordered lists are perfect for presenting items that do not have a particular sequence or order. They are typically displayed with bullet points, which make them visually distinct from ordered lists. An example might be a grocery shopping list. To create an unordered list, you can use the <ul> (unordered list) element and nest individual list items within <li> (list item) elements:
we can customized default bulletpoint style by "type" attribute in ul tag. default is disc, we can make it circle, square, and none 
    
Unordered List (<ul>) Styles:
Disc (list-style-type: disc;): Default style - filled circles.
Circle (list-style-type: circle;): Hollow circles.
Square (list-style-type: square;): Squares.
None (list-style-type: none;): No bullet points.

<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

ORDERED LIST
Ordered lists, as the name suggests, are useful when you want to present items in a specific sequence or order. They are displayed with numbers orletters by default, but you can customize the numbering style using CSS. An example might be a ranked list of your favorite movies. To create anordered list, use the <ol> (ordered list) element and nest list items within <li> elements: 

Ordered List (<ol>) Styles:

Decimal (list-style-type: decimal;): Default style - decimal numbers.
Lowercase Letters (list-style-type: lower-alpha;): Lowercase letters (a, b, c).
Uppercase Letters (list-style-type: upper-alpha;): Uppercase letters (A, B, C).
Lowercase Roman Numerals (list-style-type: lower-roman;): Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii).
Uppercase Roman Numerals (list-style-type: upper-roman;): Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III) 

The start attribute specifies the start value of the first list item in an ordered list. This value is always an integer, even when the numbering type is letters or romans. E.g., to start counting list items from the letter "c" or the roman number "iii", use start="3".


<p>example of ordered list</p>
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

DESCRIPTION LIST
The <dl> HTML element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs)


<dl>
    <dt>Beast of Bodmin</dt>
    <dd>A large feline inhabiting Bodmin Moor.</dd>

    <dt>Morgawr</dt>
    <dd>A sea serpent.</dd>

    <dt>Owlman</dt>
    <dd>A giant owl-like creature.</dd>
</dl>
