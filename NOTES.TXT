HISTORY OF HTML => Early Beginnings (1980's) The concept of hypertext was proposed by computer scientist Ted Nelson in the 1960s. In the 1980s,Berners-lee, a British computer scientist introduced the world wide web (www) and developed the first HTML.

Que 6 :- what is html syntax?
<h1> THIS IS H1 TAG </h1>
here <h1> is opening tag || THIS IS H1 TAG is content || </h1> is closeing tag -> the conbination of opening tag closeing tag and content is syntax in html.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 7 :- what is difference between tag and syntax?
HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not. There is a subtle difference between HTML elements and tags that many people aren't aware of.

HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should display content to the user. A tag starts with a < bracket and ends with a > bracket. Most tags exist in pairs in HTML. Tags have an opening and closing part. They are similar, except the closing part has a / sign after the opening bracket.

Opening tag: <TagName>
Closing tag: </TagName>

HTML Element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag. HTML Elements are components of the web page. Let's say we created a div block and filled it with some text. Then the text-filled div becomes the component of the HTML Page. The <div></div> tags along with the content inside it becomes a component and HTML Element. This will be rendered and shown to the user.

<p>This is an element<p>

An HTML element consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

Que 8 :- What is the index in html?
index.html is an HTML file that serves as the home page for a website. It's often the first file that visitors to a website will see.

-------------------------------------------------

Que 9 :- Document structure in HTML or boilerplate code. ( https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure )

HTML documents include a document type declaration { <!DOCTYPE html> } and the { <html> </html> } root element. Nested in the <html> element are the document head {  <head> </head> } and document body { <body> </body> } . While the head of the document isn't visible to the sighted visitor, it is vital to make your site function. It contains all the meta information, including information for search engines and social media results, icons for the browser tab and mobile home screen shortcut, and the behavior and presentation of your content.


<!DOCTYPE html> 
The first thing in any HTML document is the preamble. For HTML, all you need is <!DOCTYPE html>. This may look like an HTML element, but it isn't. All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: <!DOCTYPE html>.



<html></html>
The <html> element is the root element for an HTML document. It is the parent of the <head> and <body>, containing everything in the HTML document other than the doctype. It is important to include it, as this is the element on which the language of the content of the document is declared.
<html lang="en"> </html> - The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content. Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French, and so on.

The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. The value of the lang attribute is a two- or three-letter ISO language code followed by the region. The region is optional, but recommended, as a language can vary greatly between regions. For example, French is very different in Canada (fr-CA) versus Burkina Faso (fr-BF). This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and translation services to know the document language.

The lang attribute is not limited to the <html>tag. If there is text within the page that is in a language different from the main document language, the lang attribute should be used to identify exceptions to the main language within the document. Just like when it is included in the head, the lang attribute in the body has no visual effect. It only adds semantics, enabling assistive technologies and automated services to know the language of the impacted content.



<head></head>
The <head>, or document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application. The body contains the visible content. The rest of this section focuses on the components found nested inside the opening and closing <head></head>

Que 10 :- What is attribute in html?
Attribute are used along with the HTML tags to define the characterstics of the element. Attribute provide additional information about elements.
-> All HTML elements can have attributes
-> Attributes provide additional information about elements
-> Attributes are always specified in the start tag
-> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

-------------------------------------------------

The h1 to h6 tags create heading in HTML, where h1 is most important and biggest and h6 is the smallest and least important.
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
There are six heading tag h1,h2,h3,h4,h,h6.  <h1> tag is typically, larger and bold in apperence, around 24px to 36px or even larger. and further thicknes and boldness of heading tag decrease as we go down to h2,h3,h4,h,h6,
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
